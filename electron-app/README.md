## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or later
- npm or yarn
- Python 3 (for the cache cleaning backend)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start

# Or use the convenience script
./run.sh
```

### Building for Distribution

```bash
# Build distributable app
npm run dist

# Or use the build script
./build.sh
```

This will create a `.dmg` file in the `dist/` directory that can be distributed to users.

## Architecture

The app consists of:

- **Main Process** (`main.js`): Handles system interactions and Python script execution
- **Renderer Process** (`renderer.js`): Manages the UI and user interactions
- **Preload Script** (`preload.js`): Provides secure communication between processes
- **Python Backend**: Uses the existing `cache_cleaner.py` for actual cleaning operations

## Technologies Used

- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop app framework
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Modern web technologies for the UI
- **Chart.js**: For the disk usage visualization
- **Python**: Backend cleaning operations
