## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Protected Directories
The app never touches these critical system areas:
- `/System`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc`
- `/Applications`, `/Library/Frameworks`
- Essential system caches (Spotlight, LaunchServices, etc.)

### Age-Based Cleaning
- Only removes cache files older than 7 days
- Preserves recent files that may still be needed
- Logs and temporary files are cleaned more aggressively

### Dry Run Mode
- **Always recommended first**: See exactly what will be cleaned
- No files are deleted in dry run mode
- Provides size estimates for space that would be freed

## üìÅ What Gets Cleaned

### User Caches
- `~/Library/Caches/*` (selective cleaning)
- `~/Library/Logs/*`
- `~/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter/*`
- `~/Library/Containers/*` (old data)

### Browser Caches
- Safari: `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari`
- Chrome: `~/Library/Caches/com.google.Chrome`
- Firefox: `~/Library/Caches/org.mozilla.firefox`
- Edge: `~/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.edgemac`

### Development Tools
- npm: `~/.npm/_cacache`
- Yarn: `~/.yarn/cache`
- pip: `~/Library/Caches/pip`
- Docker: `~/Library/Caches/com.docker.docker`
- Xcode: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`

### System Files
- `/tmp/*` (temporary files)
- `/var/tmp/*` (system temporary files)
- Old system logs (with proper permissions)

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Command Line Integration
The GUI app can also be used alongside the command-line version:

```bash
# Run CLI version for automation
./cache_cleaner.py --dry-run --verbose

# Run GUI for interactive use
python3 cache_cleaner_gui.py
```

### Customization
Edit `cache_cleaner.py` to modify:
- Cache directories to clean
- File age thresholds
- Exclusion patterns
- Cleaning behavior

### Scheduling
Set up automatic cleaning using the command-line version:
```bash
# Add to crontab for weekly cleaning
0 2 * * 0 /Users/knightdev/macos-cache-cleaner/cache_cleaner.py --skip-maintenance
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### App Won't Launch
1. **Security Warning**: Right-click ‚Üí Open ‚Üí "Open Anyway"
2. **Python Missing**: Install Python 3 from python.org
3. **Permissions**: Try running from Terminal first

### Cleaning Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Some system caches require admin rights
2. **Space Not Freed**: Restart Finder or reboot to update disk usage
3. **Slow Scanning**: Large cache directories take time to analyze

### GUI Problems
1. **Window Too Small**: Drag corners to resize
2. **Output Not Updating**: Cleaning operations run in background threads
3. **Stop Button**: Cannot force-stop mid-operation for safety

## üìä Example Cleaning Results

Typical space savings by category:
- **Browser Caches**: 500MB - 2GB
- **Development Tools**: 1GB - 5GB  
- **System Caches**: 200MB - 1GB
- **Logs & Crash Reports**: 50MB - 500MB
- **Temporary Files**: 100MB - 1GB

**Total typical savings**: 2GB - 10GB
