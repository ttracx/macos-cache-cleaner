**Version:** 1.0.0

## Features

- üßπ **Safe Cache Cleaning**: Intelligently cleans user and system caches without affecting critical system files
- üåê **Browser Data Cleanup**: Removes browser caches (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- üíª **Development Cache Cleanup**: Cleans npm, yarn, pip, Docker, and Xcode caches
- üìã **Log File Management**: Removes old log files while preserving recent ones
- üóëÔ∏è **Trash Management**: Safely empties the Trash
- üîß **System Maintenance**: Runs built-in macOS maintenance scripts
- üîç **Large File Scanner**: Identifies large files for manual review
- üîí **Safety First**: Dry-run mode and intelligent exclusions prevent accidental deletions

## Quick Start

### Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x cache_cleaner.py
```

### Run a dry-run first (recommended)
```bash
./cache_cleaner.py --dry-run --verbose
```

### Run the actual cleanup
```bash
./cache_cleaner.py
```

## Usage Options

```bash
./cache_cleaner.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --dry-run             Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
  --verbose, -v         Show detailed output
  --skip-trash          Skip emptying the trash
  --skip-maintenance    Skip running macOS maintenance scripts
  --find-large-files    Scan for large files that could be deleted
  -h, --help           Show help message
```

## What Gets Cleaned

### User Caches
- `~/Library/Caches/*` (selective cleaning)
- `~/Library/Logs/*`
- `~/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter/*`

### Browser Caches
- Safari cache
- Chrome cache
- Firefox cache
- Microsoft Edge cache

### Development Caches
- npm cache (`~/.npm/_cacache`)
- Yarn cache (`~/.yarn/cache`)
- pip cache (`~/Library/Caches/pip`)
- Docker cache
- Xcode DerivedData

### System Temporary Files
- `/tmp/*`
- `/var/tmp/*`
- Files older than 7 days in cache directories

### Log Files
- User log files
- Old system logs (with appropriate permissions)

## Safety Features

- **Protected Directories**: Never touches critical system directories
- **Age-Based Cleaning**: Only removes files older than 7 days from most cache directories
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test what would be deleted before actual cleanup
- **Permission Handling**: Gracefully handles permission errors
- **Exclusion Lists**: Skips essential system caches

## Installation as System Utility

### Option 1: Add to PATH
```bash
# Copy to a directory in your PATH
sudo cp cache_cleaner.py /usr/local/bin/macos-cleaner
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/macos-cleaner

# Now you can run from anywhere
macos-cleaner --dry-run
```

### Option 2: Create an alias
```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
echo 'alias cleaner="/Users/knightdev/macos-cache-cleaner/cache_cleaner.py"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Use the alias
cleaner --dry-run
```

### Option 3: Create a scheduled job
```bash
# Run weekly cleanup (add to crontab)
crontab -e

# Add this line to run every Sunday at 2 AM
0 2 * * 0 /Users/knightdev/macos-cache-cleaner/cache_cleaner.py --skip-maintenance
```

## Requirements

- macOS (designed for Apple Silicon but works on Intel Macs too)
- Python 3.6 or later
- Administrator privileges (for some system maintenance tasks)

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors
Some cache directories require elevated permissions. The script handles these gracefully, but you can run with `sudo` if needed:

```bash
sudo ./cache_cleaner.py
```

### Large Cache Directories
If you have very large cache directories, the initial scan might take a while. Use `--verbose` to see progress.

### Disk Space Not Freed Immediately
Some space might not appear freed immediately due to how macOS handles disk space reporting. Restart Finder or reboot if needed.
