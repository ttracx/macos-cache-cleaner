## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Why This Design?

1. **Clear Purpose**: Brush immediately suggests cleaning
2. **Professional Look**: Not cartoonish, suitable for system utility
3. **Apple Guidelines**: Follows macOS icon design principles
4. **Memorable**: Distinctive among other utility apps
5. **Scalable**: Readable at small sizes in dock/menu bar

### Alternative Concepts Considered
- 🗑️ Trash can (too generic, suggests deletion only)
- 💾 Hard drive with cleaning (too technical)
- 🧽 Sponge (less professional looking)
- ⚙️ Gear with sparkles (too mechanical)

The brush design was chosen as it best represents both the action (cleaning) and the result (sparkles/clean state).

## 📱 Icon in Use

The icon appears in various contexts:
- **App Bundle**: Main application icon
- **Dock**: When app is running
- **Finder**: In Applications folder
- **Spotlight**: Search results
- **Launchpad**: App launcher grid

At all sizes, the icon maintains its clarity and recognizability, making it easy for users to identify the Cache Cleaner app.
