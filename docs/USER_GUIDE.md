# Quick scan alias
alias cache-scan="/path/to/cache_cleaner.py --dry-run --verbose"

# Safe clean alias
alias cache-clean="/path/to/cache_cleaner.py --skip-trash"

# Deep clean alias
alias cache-deep="sudo /path/to/cache_cleaner.py"
```

## Understanding Cache Types

### System Caches (`~/Library/Caches`)
- **What**: Application temporary files
- **Safe to delete**: Yes, apps will recreate as needed
- **Impact**: Apps may load slower initially
- **Space savings**: Usually 1-10GB

### Browser Caches
- **What**: Websites, images, scripts
- **Safe to delete**: Yes, but you'll be logged out
- **Impact**: Websites load slower initially
- **Space savings**: 500MB-5GB per browser

### Development Caches
- **npm** (`~/.npm`): Node.js packages
- **pip** (`~/Library/Caches/pip`): Python packages
- **Xcode** (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`): Build artifacts
- **Docker**: Container and image caches
- **Safe to delete**: Yes, but may need to re-download
- **Space savings**: Can be 10GB+ for developers

### Log Files
- **What**: Application and system logs
- **Safe to delete**: Old logs (>7 days)
- **Impact**: Lose troubleshooting history
- **Space savings**: 100MB-2GB

### Temporary Files
- **What**: System and app temporary data
- **Safe to delete**: Yes for old files
- **Impact**: None for old files
- **Space savings**: Varies widely

## Cleaning Strategies

### Conservative Approach
For users who prioritize stability:
1. Always run dry-run first
2. Use safe clean mode
3. Keep verbose output on
4. Review results before actual cleaning
5. Clean monthly

### Balanced Approach
For most users:
1. Use safe clean weekly
2. Deep clean quarterly
3. Empty trash during cleaning
4. Skip system maintenance unless needed
5. Monitor disk usage trends

### Aggressive Approach
For power users with backups:
1. Deep clean monthly
2. Include system maintenance
3. Regularly scan for large files
4. Automate with cron jobs
5. Clean development caches frequently

- Protected directory list
- Age-based cleaning (7-day threshold)
- Dry-run mode
- No critical system files touched

### Q: How often should I clean?
**A**: 
- Light users: Monthly
- Regular users: Bi-weekly

### Q: What if something breaks?
**A**: 
1. Caches rebuild automatically
2. Log out/in to refresh system caches
3. Restart affected applications
4. Check the output log for issues

### Q: Can I undo a cleaning?
**A**: No, but:
- Use dry-run to preview
- Caches regenerate naturally
- Trash items can be restored (if not emptied)

### Q: Why isn't more space freed?
**A**: Possible reasons:
- macOS purgeable space
- APFS snapshots
- Large files in other locations
- System protection preventing deletion

### Q: Is the AI assistant private?
**A**: Yes, completely:
- Runs locally via Ollama
- No internet connection required
- No data sent externally
- Model stored on your machine

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied" errors**:
- Run with `sudo` for system maintenance
- Check file ownership
- Ensure admin privileges

**AI Assistant offline**:
1. Install Ollama: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`
2. Run setup: `./setup-ollama.sh`
3. Check service: `ollama list`

**App won't start**:
1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (need 16+)
2. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
3. Check for port conflicts

**No space freed after cleaning**:
1. Restart Finder
2. Empty trash manually
3. Check for APFS snapshots: `tmutil listlocalsnapshots /`
4. Restart Mac if needed
